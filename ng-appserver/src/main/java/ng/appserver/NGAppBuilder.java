/// We need a builder class to create/run our applications.
/// What I'd b love to have is
///
/// 1. Build an application without running it
/// 2. Specify the application's deployment mode
/// 3. Specify which plugins to load
///  - Specify whether to automatically load all located plugins
///  - Disable certain plugins
///  - Change plugin initialization/load/activation order?
/// 4. Launch the given application with a specified "adaptor" (might potentially belong in a separate class?)
